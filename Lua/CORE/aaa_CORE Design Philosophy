CORE is intended to be akin to a new standard library. Despite common Lua practice, very few things in CORE are namespaced in tables. Variable and function names are decisive and must be worked around by the user.
In this way, CORE can be thought of as emulating a series of optional updates to CYF, or as an engine overhaul like CYK. While files should be relatively modular, each should itself be considered a fundamental change.
